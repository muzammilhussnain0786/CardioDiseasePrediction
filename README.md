# Context
These are the previous GCSE examination grades for the last four years at an English Underperforming School. The idea is to find a ML model that would predict future grades for students based on their profile (SEN,PP,HML,Reading, Writing and Maths Grades).

Idea is to predict the following grades (1-9 whole grades)
Att8Act = Attainment 8 Actual (Best 8 grades for students)
EngAct = English grade
MatAct = Maths grade

# Content
- PP = Pupil Premium
- EAL = English as Additional Language
- HML = Ability based on previous results ages 10/11. H= Higher, M = Middle, L = Lower
- Re = Reading grade at aged 10
- Wr = Writing grade at aged 10
- Ma = Maths grade at aged 10

Your data will be in front of the world's largest data science community. What questions do you want to see answered?

Can ML help predict future grades and look at interventions for students entering the school in the future?
